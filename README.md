# Tetris
This project is a simple version of tetris. The game has falling tetrimenos that are randomly generated and the user must place them
to make lines before the tetrimenos stack up.

Keyboard controls:
Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the falling tetrimenos.
The 'r' key rotates the tetrimeno.
The 'q' key quits the game.
